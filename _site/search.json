The idea is using this to replace my current github pages personal page - quarto is a tool that I understand way better than the complex template I am currently using, and being able to write it all in markdown would be a blessing.\nEven more, I am looking forward to having a space to write a personal blog, with minimal fuss - no CMS, no complex dependencies. Just write markdown, render, push. Heck, I might even just write markdown and push, and use a github action to do the rendering.\nFor now, this lives in a separate repo, while I iron out things and try to make it look nice(r)."
