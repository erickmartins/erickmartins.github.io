    "text": "So as a first real blogpost I decided it was a good idea to write a quick recap/summary of what happened during the OME 2024 Community Meeting - it’s both a pretty easy write for me and potentially helpful for other folks out there.\n\n\n\nDid you know there’s a Lemmings statue in Dundee?\n\n\n\n\nProbably a good place to start is explaining OME - according to themselves,\n\na consortium of universities, research labs, industry and developers producing open-source software and format standards for microscopy data.\n\nIn practice, it’s a community of like-minded tool developers who write things that are 1) open-source; 2) dealing with microscopy data; 3) uses the OME data model to some degree - and the users of such tools. In the past (i.e. pre-pandemic), this was a relatively large meeting (100-200 people is my guess?), with lots of end-users presenting their use cases.\nPost-pandemic, this survived in a kinda-barebones, virtual-only format for a few years, until May this year, when we finally managed to meet in person again, in lovely Dundee, Scotland. Even better, I was invited to give a talk! (for the record, this is the second time ever I had an proper invited talk, and the first time I managed to be there to actually give it.). Though much smaller than previous meetings (attendance was around 45 people), most of the big names are core developers were there.\n\n\n\nthe day before the conference, I climbed a hill\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo the day before the actual meeting, the people giving invited talks had the chance to have dinner together - it’s the kind of informal opportunity to network and enjoy each other’s company that is really hard to replicate virtually, and after 5 years without in-person meetings, it was great to see many familiar faces! We also had a LOT of tapas. I did not take pictures, so you’ll have to believe me.\n\n\n\nThis was the main “conference day” - invited talks from all over the world, about how institutions and cross-institutional entities are involved in the OME ecosystem. This is where we (i.e. The Jackson Laboratory folks) gave our invited talk, and essential projects around OME (such as Bio-formats and the IDR gave community updates.\nThe big takeaway in my opinion was that large national entities, such as German Bioimaging, France Bioimaging and NL-Bioimaging, are deeptly invested in OME. Similarly, large public data repositories also rely heavily on the tools the data models of the OME environment; not only the IDR, but also things like the Bioimage Archive and SSBD. These entities have a mix of either centralized and distributed infrastructure, and very different ideas for what metadata standards should look like, making harmonization between these disparate cases pretty hard.\nStill, some common themes have emerged, such as the desire to have common metadata standards, and a convergence towards using OME-Zarr as the file format for the future. We are seeing, for example, multiple efforts for processing OME-Zarr using Slurm/HPC have emerged (such as the awesome Fractal). The day ended with very good food (you’ll start to sense a theme here) at Dundee Contemporary Arts.\n\n\n\nFor the first half of day 2, we had a few more talks, focusing on using OMERO in training settings - it included an initially funny, but then just awesome story about a collaboration with an Indonesian university, which was unwittingly “abusing” the demo OMERO server provided by the University of Dundee to teach pathology classes to medical students. The “abuse” was discovered and, instead of just cutting them off, a partnership was developed, and now Dundee hosts a separate server for the Indonesian folks.\nThe second half of day 2 was dedicated to workshops - we had breakout rooms with a few scheduled sessions, and an extra room for impromptu/ad-hoc sessions. The sessions I attended had a lot of Zarr talk, including the first discussions of a “Dundee Pledge” - an attempt to align the folks in the room around a set of practices and tools that would allow for easily extensible metadata. Again, the day ended with excellent food - this time, at an Indian place whose name escapes me right now.\n\n\n\nDay 3 was a half-day, scheduled to end at lunchtime. It was “organized” as an unmeeting - participants decided what the agenda of day 3 would be at the beginning of the day. What ended up happening was a lot of work and discussion around what eventually became the OME2024 NGFF Challenge.\nSo what is that? In brief, in Josh Moore’s words,\n\nconverting some significant corpus of day (e.g., 1 PB) using what we think the next version of OME-Zarr (e.g., including sharding, collections, etc.) will be by the end of September.\n\nIt’s an ambitious plan: it involves fast-forwarding some specifications in a pretty speculative way, coordinating multiple entities and institutions, and herding cats in a very short timeframe. The plan is to, very quickly, demonstrate that this is a viable way of going in the future, and speed up tool development in some areas. Excitingly, since as part of the challenge multiple institutions agree on a (very) minimal metadata standard, that means a single front-end can index and search data that exists in many different storage sources, paving the way for a future where public data repositories can be fully federated.\nSince then, multiple working groups have made quick progress, and in two days we are hitting the date where specifications for the challenge will enter a freeze. That will give people time to get their tooling in order, and to actually convert the data they will provide for the challenge. Needless to say, we at JAX will be taking part in it, planning to offer around 50TB of Zarr files to it.\nI am told this day ended with a scotch tasting - I had an early plane to catch and ended up skipping it.\n\n\n\nThe idea is to continue in-person meetings for next year - folks in the US have soft-committed to organizing it this side of the pond next year. We’re still looking for a location (probably on the East Coast), but there’s already work being done towards that!\n\n\n\n\nI think it’s fair to say this was the most intense (and probably the best) scientific meeting I have ever attended - the fact that this is very much the niche where I spend most of my time, and the relatively small size of the meeting, meant that every waking hour was spent having meaningful, important discussions. You’d go for breakfast and other folks would be there, already talking shop. Then you’d spend the whole day at the conference, then have dinner at the conference, then go grab drinks with the conference folks. Of course, there was plenty of time for less-professional talk as well, but but you still had to be “on”. I am VERY excited for next year already - especially if it ends up being in our backyard!"

    "text": "So what is this meeting?\nIt is a question I had going in. This was my first time attending a BINA meeting in person, and looking at the schedule beforehand it felt a bit… I don’t want to sound negative because, as you will see, my feelings coming out of it were very positive, but navel-gaze-y? Most sessions seemed to be individual BINA working groups giving updates on what they have been doing, then a few keynotes, and that was most of the schedule.\nI was very, very happy to be completely wrong about it. It became very clear quickly that yes, this is a pretty tight-knit community, but one that is open and welcoming. Each working group had full freedom to do whatever they wanted with the session allocated to it; a couple gave work updates, others gave the space for individual people to give talks, there were multiple panel discussions. It was much more varied and productive than I was expecting, and genuinely very good."

    "section": "What worked well?",
    "text": "What worked well?\nWell, I just talked a bit about the schedule itself; I think giving working groups freedom to use their time as they saw fit was a big plus. Generally, I found the schedule extremely good: sessions were 1:30 at most, and we never had multiple sessions back-to-back. That kept people energized and meant there were plenty of breaks, which is both beneficial in terms of keeping an engaged audience and in making it clear that this was a conference structured around getting people talking to each other. That was emphasized by the long lunch breaks and breaks between the last session of the day and dinner. At this point, I think any in-person meeting should have such a focus; we can watch talks from home, but face time is scarce and should be maximized.\nWe had some excellent keynotes, such as Eric Betzig giving a talk honoring his late friend Mike Davidson and my good buddy Virginie Uhlmann from the BioVisionCenter in Zurich. We had my other good buddy Beth Cimini accepting the inaugural Mike Davidson Memorial Award (which she thoroughly deserves!). We had multiple dinners at the waterfront. Overall I had a fantastic time meeting old friends, reconnecting with folks I hadn’t seen in a while, meeting folks I only knew from the Internet for the first time, and making completely new connections that are already paying off.\nSpeaking of: this meeting used an online platform for its program and attendees list that included an online chat capability, and I found that extremely useful. First, knowing who would be there made me mentally establish a list of folks I should go talk to, and second because I had a couple of people reaching out to me via online chat before the conference asking for a chance to connect in person during the meeting, which made me go out of my way to find those people and engage with them. Highly recommend for other meetings!"

    "text": "So what could be better?\nHonestly? Not much. I think my one “room for improvement” note is that working groups felt like they were all doing their own thing despite obvious areas of overlap between them, where they could be working together. Whether that should be achieved by overlap in membership between groups or by having cross-group meetings and activities I am not sure, but I would love to see more of that! (spoilers: the nature of the 2025 meeting might force teams to have cross-group sessions, which is a good first step.)"

    "text": "So what is this meeting?\nWhen I moved to the US five years ago, I felt very lonely. Professionally, I mean. Two years inside the rich bioimage analysis community in the UK (and in Europe more generally) spoiled me, and discovering there was no regular bioimage analysis meeting in the US, no support network, no structured community of practice, was a big blow. All of sudden it made sense that I kept running into people from the US at every bioimage analysis meeting in Europe…\nSkip forward a couple years and a few folks at JAX plus the aforementioned Beth Cimini and the suddenly-based-in-the-US Simon Noerrelykke from the Image Analysis Collaboratory at Harvard Medical School decided enough is enough: if no one organizes a US-based bioimage analysis meeting, we might as well do it ourselves. So we did it: initially with a focus on the Northeast US and trying to establish a sense of local community in the area, we ran our first meeting in 2023. It was a single day, around 30-35 people showed up, it was great.\nThis year we went bigger: a two-day meeting. Many invited speakers. Charging participation fees. And so we get to…"

Given that we did not have a travel budget for invited speakers, a few of these talks were virtual, yes, but the average level of talks was extremely high, with many leading names in the area giving talks about their work. We got new people to attend the meeting, meet each other, have conversations with other folks working in similar positions elsewhere.\nAnd that was the main focus of this meeting: community and connections. We scheduled plenty of “downtime” to allow for conversations to blossom, and that was a success. I met many people I didn’t know, and I was the one inviting speakers! I think it was a huge success both in terms of networking and in pure scientific terms. We even dragged, I mean, gently invited folks for dinner at Parkville Market, which folks seemed to enjoy a lot.\n\n\n\nTalley Lambert himself graced us with his presence! I had never met Talley before this."

    "text": "What could be better?\nWell, this is a… small meeting. We had 20-25 people in person, plus a handful online. Which is about half of what I’d like this meeting to be. A bit of that was unfortunate scheduling (a large imaging meeting was scheduled for conflicting dates after we had already announced ours!), some of it is that we’re still not reaching the people we’d like to reach, some of it is that we’d probably get more people if this meeting was in Boston. Still work to do.\nOrganizing an event is exhausting. This year was mainly on my shoulders (with help from the Education team at JAX), and it was STRESSFUL. Organizing this every year at JAX is just not feasible without me losing years of my lifespan. So we need to think about what this looks like long-term."

    "title": "My August project: Boku no Natsuyasumi 2",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Playing Boku no Natsuyasumi 2 every single day in August has been a delight.\n\n\n\nMeeting people is hard.\n\n\nIf you’ve never heard of Boku no Natsuyasumi (My Summer Vacation): it’s a very popular series of games in Japan, where the basic premise is that you are a young child going to spend your (titular) summer vacation somewhere. You can think of it as Animal Crossing-adjacent: you explore a cute location, interact with the people living there, catch some fish and some bugs, and so on. There’s a day-night cycle, certain things are only available at certain times, you know the drill.\n\n\n\nThe Akane house in Fumi became my second residence for August.\n\n\nNone of the Bokunatsu games saw a western release, ever. (the newer stuff from the same studio, Millenium Kitchen, is available, though.) It’s one of those series that people who are deep enough into the rabbit hole that is gaming talked about without full context, and western folks who can speak Japanese raved about. And then, a group of extremely dedicated fans carefully put together an English translation of Bokunatsu 2. I cannot say enough glowing things about the work they’ve done here, both in terms of the quality of the prose itself and the absolute technical marvel that this translation is. For example, the original game has vertical text; they somehow converted that into a horizontal textbox at the bottom of the screen.\n\n\n\nYou do get to open this gate if you want to.\n\n\nI’ll get this out of the way: Boku no Natsuyasumi 2 is wonderful. It’s a small miracle. It’s warm, gentle, thoughtful, and just a tiny little bit sappy at times. It made me feel nostalgic for rural Japan in the 70s, a time and space I had very little knowledge about.\nSo the game starts and it’s August 1st, 1975. You’re a 9-year old kid named Boku (I know), taking the ferry to Fumi, a tiny little community somewhere in Japan. Your mom is about to give birth to a child, and your parents sent you over to stay with your aunt and uncle in Fumi so you don’t need to be around for that. That’s it. This is all you’re given. There are no objectives, no tutorials, nothing you need to do. You’re a kid on vacation, staying in a small village with your extended family and the locals. Have fun. You’ll have breakfast and dinner with your family at set times, and you have a limit for your bed time. Those are the only limitations.\nI love how open-ended everything is. There were many things that I’ve certainly missed, some things I only discovered when it was too late to do them properly, and so on. It’s a game that clearly doesn’t expect you to see everything in a single playthrough, and getting rid of that minmaxing bug in your brain is a good thing here. In just a few in-game days, I was able to let go of the instinct to optimize and just enjoy being a weird kid running around this village.\n\n\n\nI genuinely have no idea if this scene always happens or if some of the stuff I did made it happen.\n\n\nBoku is a wonderful protagonist - the way this kid is written and voiced made me smile all the time. Boku is a kind-hearted, curious, very funny kid, who asks good questions and likes teasing people. But he’s very much a kid. He doesn’t understand some things even when you, the player, does; there’s nothing you can do in-game to change that. You are not Boku.\n\n\n\nGramps had some stuff to take off his chest.\n\n\nNow for some added fun: as I said, this is a game that starts on August 1st, 1975. Following a friend’s suggestion, I decided to play one in-game day per real-life day. It didn’t end up mapping one to one for a number of reasons, but I did my best. I know there’s no such thing as the right way to play a game but honestly? This might be the right way to play this game. If you’re in the northern hemisphere. And you live in a place with seasons. The reminders that summer is ending in-game synchronizing with the first slightly chillier days where I am worked really, really well. Everyone’s mood shifts as fall is starting to peek around the corner: the people in the game and myself. It also helps that each day takes about half an hour if you’re playing on the default speed. It’s a totally reasonable time commitment for a daily task, right there with my crosswords.\nThe one thing I’m divided on is whether to do this again next year. One one hand, I would love to go back to Fumi, see the things I didn’t see, do the things I didn’t do. But at the same time, I love where Boku’s story ended at. This month of August felt like my version of what Boku’ August would have been, and to some degree going back to it would just undermine its power by making me optimize more, focus less on enjoying the scenery and the people in the village. Ultimately, I worry that re-experiencing August 1975 would make this month less unique.\n\n\n\nBoku loves to sit at a place and just vibe."

    "text": "Final Fantasy VII Rebirth\nI think FFVII Remake, the game before this one, was the most pleasant surprise I’ve had with a game in a long, long time. It felt like an impossible project: remaking one of the most beloved games ever. They somehow pulled it off, making something that was simultaneously very close to the original and an interesting, original story, which opened up so many cool possibilities for whatever came next.\nWhat came next was this, pardon my french, wet fart. A bloated, confused mess of a game. A game where nothing happens for 100h, and then you get the most lukewarm, middle-of-the-road conclusion possible. They could have done literally anything with this game, and they chose to do nothing. The worst kind of checklist game. It’s very rare that I get genuinely angry at a video game, but this one managed to do it. Multiple times."

I did not go all the way into the rabbit hole (a lil joke here for the people who played Animal Well), and stopped when I felt satisfied, and that took me about 15h. Not an easy game, but very, very interesting and worth playing.\n\n\n\nyou play as a certified little guy (the meatball-looking dude there)"

Still, it’s undeniably a very cool idea extremely well executed, for better or worse. Definitely a game I preferred to admire from a distance."

And a really good one? This game looks absolutely INCREDIBLE, has a genuinely interesting story that went places I did not expect (in a very, very positive way), and hit a difficulty level with its puzzles that was just right for me - a good mix of “you can solve this easily as soon as you find the relevant info” and “you might need some slightly lateral thinking to understand what’s being asked”. Maybe on the level of, say, a moderately difficult escape room; also, very much like an escape room, it is a game that gives you ALL the relevant info to solve its puzzles, even when there’s a reasonable argument to be made that most people know about it (though I guess I am being unkind to folks who do not know Roman Numerals).\n\n\n\ntfw the magician gives you a bunch of symbols"

It’s very clearly inspired by The Case of the Golden Idol: you have little vignettes where you are presented with items and information, and then you need to fill in the blanks in some text (à la madlibs) explaining what has happened in that scene. It’s pretty easy, pretty short, pretty funny. A decent couple-hours of fun, but not the most inspiring thing I’ve ever played."

    "text": "The Rise of the Golden Idol\nThis is the sequel to The Case of the Golden Idol, one of my favorite games of 2022. This is still a very similar formula to that game: you are presented with a scene (or a series of scenes) and you poke around at it until you figure out what has transpired, and then you fill in the blanks: the name of the people involved, some text describing the actions that took place, and sometimes more involved (and more creative) things that I do not want to give away.\nIt is, by any aspect, a better game than the original, in my opinion, and also a more difficult one. It was extremely satisfying to slowly piece together what happens in every little bit of it, though! Chapter 4, in particular, is a delight, with two incredible puzzles (one of them is different from anything they had ever done and made me clap my hands in joy when I realized what was asked of me). It dragged on a little too long for my taste (the last couple scenarios are a bit too much), but I had an incredible time with it.\n\n\n\nthis game looks “ugly” in a way that I love"

If I was to evaluate each of its 50 (!!!) constituent games on their own merits, a solid dozen would rank very highly in my game-of-the-year list. I went into it expecting to encounter small, largely arcade-y games, and maybe enjoy a handful of them (which I’d be more than happy with!). Instead, what I found were 50 actual games: yes, a few of them are fairly slight, many of them are pretty arcade-y. But after playing a little bit of every game, the list of games I wanted to go back to had… almost half of them.\nHave I gone back to all of them? No, I haven’t. Have I gone back to most of them? Also no. But the idea that there are 20 great games there, just waiting for me to come back one day, is incredible. This game feels like a miracle; have you tried making 50 of anything? It’s a lot! They made 50 games. And they sold the whole package for, like, $25. I’ve never felt so much like I was ripping off a developer. It’s a wonderful thing, and I cannot recommend it enough.\n\n\n\nPilot Quest is a ridiculous but wonderful idea for a game. You’ll need some meat."

But there’s very few things in life I enjoy more than seeying Kazuma Kiryu and the goofballs he surrounds himself with doing some goofball stuff. These games wouldn’t work without the weird tonal shifts from super-serious-crime-drama main story and outright comedy in the side stories. They wouldn’t work if Kazuma Kiryu wasn’t the most kind-hearted head-empty dude in the world (which is why a lot of 4 and 5 don’t work super well for me). These games are a few slips away from being forgettable or actively disagreeable, and yet they manage to toe the line just right. I love them.
