# This is a test

## what am I testing?

I am trying to use [quarto](https://quarto.org) to generate a new personal website, including a personal blog. The idea is using this to replace my current github pages [personal page](https://erickmartins.github.io) - quarto is a tool that I understand way better than the complex template I am currently using, and being able to write it all in markdown would be a blessing.

Even more, I am looking forward to having a space to write a personal blog, with minimal fuss - no CMS, no complex dependencies. Just write markdown, render, push. Heck, I might even just write markdown and push, and use a github action to do the rendering.

For now, this lives in a separate repo, while I iron out things and try to make it look nice(r).
