# Playing Boku no Natsuyasumi 2 every single day in August has been a delight.

If you've never heard of Boku no Natsuyasumi (My Summer Vacation): it's a very popular series of games in Japan, where the basic premise is that you are a young child going to spend your (titular) summer vacation somewhere. You can think of it as Animal Crossing-adjacent: you explore a cute location, interact with the people living there, catch some fish and some bugs, and so on. There's a day-night cycle, certain things are only available at certain times, you know the drill.
